# Small RF Replacement

I made a smaller variant of the RF replacement board that can be used in C128 machines as well 
as in the C64C. By not supporting the "long" C64 boards with their 12V VIC, this FPGA board could be made
as small as the smaller variant of the RF modulator and this should now also fit where the original
board was too large.
